# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Add the ability to retrieve the concrete type of an arbitrary expression so that
it may be reused by other code that relies on the expression.

Within the context of a macro, this feature would be very useful.

It would allow for:

- Defining a function that takes the concrete type of a given expression.
- Calling upon type-level functions based upon a given expression.

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Given some value `x`, we can retrieve its type with just `x.type`. This type can
then be used within various contexts:

```rust
let x = "hellooo";
let y: x.type = x; // C equivalent: typeof(x) y = x;

type X = x.type;

assert_eq_type!(X, &str); // taken from `static_assertions`

assert!(<x.type>::default().is_empty());
```

Note that if the expression resolves to a long operation, the operation will
_not_ be evaluated.

```rust
type T = do_stuff().do_more().type;
```

This feature is especially useful within macros when wanting to generate
functions or types based off of the given expression.

```rust
let x: Value = /* ... */;

macro_rules! do_stuff {
    ($x:expr) => {
        let y = <$x.type>::new(/* ... */);
        $x.do_stuff_with(y);
    }
}

do_stuff!(x);
```

When we get `x.type` here, it is no different than just substituting it directly
with `Value`. This allows for accessing all type-specific functionality.

This isn't possible with the current mechanism for getting the type of an
expression:

```rust
macro_rules! do_stuff {
    ($x:expr) => {
        fn with_type_of<T>(x: T) {
            let y = T::new(/* ... */);
            x.do_stuff_with(y);
        }
        with_type_of($x);
    }
}
```

[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

I am uncertain of how this would be implemented within the compiler but I
imagine that it would leverage the work that's already been done with `const`
generics.

Some cases to be aware of are non-simple expressions, such as `1 + 1`. It is
understood that this has a type of `i32` by default, but such an expression may
be difficult to parse in a generic context.

The following may only be possible in this form:

```rust
do_stuff::<{1 + 1}.type>();
```

See [unresolved questions](#unresolved-questions) for more regarding the above
example.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

By using a postfix syntax, one may write a long expression only to realize that
nothing before the `.type` part will actually not be evaluated. However, such
code would be in a context where it's obvious that the expression isn't
important.

```rust
do_thing::<send_request().await?.body().await?.contents.type>();
```

To be fair, this isn't the [weirdest thing in Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/run-pass/weird-exprs.rs).

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

Retrieving the type via the overloaded `.` operator feels like a natural
extension of the language.

As of this writing, the lang team [has come to a final
decision](https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/await-decision-ii/) regarding the
syntax for `await`, and that is to make it a postfix operation: `expr.await`.
This sets a precedent of allowing reserved keywords in what would otherwise be
the position for a property access.

## Alternatives

- A `type_of!` macro:

  ```rust
  type T = type_of!(expr);
  ```

  However, this would be more awkward when used in a generic context:

  ```rust
  type V = Vec<type_of!(elem)>;
  ```

  Depending on current parser limitations, it may need to be surrounded by
  braces when in a generic context.

- A freestanding magical `typeof()` "function" in the same style as in C:

  ```rust
  type T = typeof(expr);
  ```

  The `typeof` identifier is already reserved as a keyword and so placing it into
  the `std`/`core` prelude would not be a breaking change.

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

## C

As a compiler extension, GCC allows for getting the type of an expression via
[`typeof()`](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Typeof.html). This is often used
within macros to create intermediate bindings for inputs so as to not evaluate
inputs more than once.

For example, a safe `max` macro that evaluates its arguments exactly once can be
defined as:

```c
#define max(a, b) \
    ({  typeof(a) _a = (a); \
        typeof(b) _b = (b); \
        _a > _b ? _a : _b; })
```

Of course, with Rust's type inference, this same workaround isn't necessary.

## Swift

Swift's `type(of:)` produces runtime metatype value, upon which type-level
functions can be called.

```swift
let value = "Hola"              // String
let valueType = type(of: value) // String.Type

let other = valueType.init(["H", "o", "l", "a"]) // String

assert(value == other)
```

## Other Languages

Many other languages include a `typeof` feature, as can be seen in
[this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeof).

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- An issue that `const` generics deals with is needing to wrap the expression in
  braces (e.g. `{expr}`).

  What situations would require the expression before `.type` to be wrapped in
  braces as well?

  Would this always be necessary in the context of expressions more complicated
  than providing one without spaces? (e.g. `f::<{a + b}.type>()`)

- Would an expression provided within a macro as a `:expr` be exempt from the
  above requirement?

  ```rust
  macro_rules! call_f {
      ($x:expr) => { f::<$x.type>() }
  }

  call_f!(2 + 2);
  ```

  This works within the context of `const` generics and so one can imagine that
  it would also work here.

- Would the following work?

  ```rust
  type T = (2 + 2).type;
  ```

  Or would it be restricted to:

  ```rust
  type T = {2 + 2}.type;
  ```

This can push forward the capabilities of macros greatly and make them on-par
with C++ templates.
